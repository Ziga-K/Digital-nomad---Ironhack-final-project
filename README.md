## objective: 

- Use some of nomadlist.com data for insight on whats makes cities attractive for expats, either for visit or live in. 

- Build machine learning model to predict the city rank and possibly a city reccomendation code - this part is work in progress, would be explored and added later on...

## Overall steps:

- Webscraping with Python and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) - See 1.nomadlist_scrape file.

- Build, clean and manipulate data into a dataframe with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - see 2.clean_loc_data file.

- Getting location data with [Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.) and [Pycountry](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/).

## Result:
